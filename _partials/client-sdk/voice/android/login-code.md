When the login is successful, the logged in `NexmoUser` returns. For convenience, save a reference to `NexmoUser` on `NexmoHelper`, and then, start `MainActivity`.

Complete the `loginToSdk()` method implementation:

```tabbed_content
source: '_tutorials_tabbed_content/client-sdk/in-app-voice/android/login'
frameless: false
```

At this point you should already be able to run the app and see that you can login successfully with the SDK.
